# Comparing Bayesian and Likelihood Joint Models for Longitudinal and Survival Data: An Application to Oral Cancer Dataset Analysis
A project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in the faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (Department of Statistics).

In this report, we first provide a brief review of models used for analyzing longitudinal and survival data. Then, we discuss common approaches for estimating joint models using different statistical methods, including likelihood and Bayesian methods.
